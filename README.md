# BananaTUI

BananaTUI is a simple TUI library for Scala 3. With it, you can make option-based TUI interfaces for your programs.

BananaTUI only depends on a terminal environment that supports ANSI, and so it works on nearly all terminal environments and emulators, except for the default terminal that comes with Powershell on Windows.
